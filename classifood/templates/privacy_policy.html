            </div>

            <p>Effective September 15, 2014</p>

            <p>We (“Classifood Inc.”) are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your use of www.classifood.com (“Website”) is as secure and enjoyable as possible. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect information from you during your use of the Website, and how we use that information.</p>

            <p class="bold">What we collect</p>

            <p>If you register for an account, then you will do so by using your Google account information. We will collect your email address and Google account ID number. If you establish a “shopping list” or a “pantry”, and/or answer a survey, then we will note such data in association with your Google account information.</p>

            <p>Your use of the Website will be done anonymously. We may log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of how you use the Website, but we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged into your account. We may use “cookies” to understand your use of the Website and improve your experience (see “Cookies” below).</p>

            <p class="bold">How we use your personal information</p>

            <p>We may use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To respond to requests for information or services.</li>
                <li>To confirm your identity.</li>
                <li>To provide customer support.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="bold">Who we share it with</p>

            <p>We never sell or rent your personal information; we may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or in good faith to (a) comply with legal processes served on the site, or (b) protect the rights and property of Classifood, or (c) where our records indicate fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of, or (d) where your communication suggests possible harm to others.</p>

            <p>In the event that Classifood, or any operation thereunder, is transferred or sold, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information to the entity or entities that have taken control of or purchased Classifood. If that happens, the new entity or entities will adhere to a privacy policy that is at least as stringent as this policy.</p>

            <p class="bold">Security of your Personal Information</p>

            <p>Your personal information is never shared with outside parties without your permission, except under conditions explained above, and data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Our Website uses secure socket layer (“SSL”) encryption to protect your personal information whenever it is collected or transmitted.</p>

            <p>No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your username and password, so do not share these with others. If you believe that an unauthorized person has gained access to your username and/or password, please notify us immediately by contacting us.</p>

            <p class="bold">Access to your Personal Information</p>

            <p>You may review and update your personal information at any time by contacting us.</p>

            <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your data.</p>

            <p class="bold">Use of Cookies</p>

            <p>Our Website does generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to the Website. This information is used for internal purposes only. The statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.</p>

            <p>The Website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
